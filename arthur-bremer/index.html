                <p>At the start of the 2015 season, MLB implented new rules to shorten the length of games. Since the pace of game rules were applied, we've already seen a drop in average game time from a record high during the 2014 season.
                <br>
                <br>
                The team with the longest average game time for a season within this 25-year period was the 2014 Boston Red Sox at 197 minutes.  The team with the shortest average game time for a season was the 2003 Detroit Tigers at 159 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                There was a noticeable drop in the average length of games in the mid-2000s before beginning to rise again. The earlier peak in average game length may be attributed to more offensive runs being scored per game, but as game length peaked to a new high in 2014, teams were averaging fewer runs, which may have inspired the new pace rules,<a href="http:\\www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24682428/chart-the-rise-of-the-three-hour-baseball-game"> according to an article by CBS sports writer Dayn Perry.</a>
