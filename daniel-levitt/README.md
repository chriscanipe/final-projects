Front office executives around the league get paid vast sums of money to decide the direction of their ball club, but are they making it harder than it should be?

Data from the past sixteen MLB seasons shows that there's strong correlation between the number of games a team wins and it's ERA. Over this time span, general managers are better off assembling a great pitching staff than lineup.

Since 2000, 88 percent of teams that made the playoffs had an ERA below the league average. In comparison, 77 percent of those teams scored more runs than the league average. You're probably thinking there's not a whole lot in it. But since former MLB Commissioner Bud Selig added a second wild card to the American and National Leagues for the 2012 season, those figures have gone in opposite directions.

In the past four seasons, the number of playoff teams with run totals in the league's upper half dropped to 73 percent, whereas playoff teams with ERAs below the league average soared to 90 percent. In other words, nine of out every ten playoff teams has one of the better ERAs in the league.

Pitching wins ball games, folks.
